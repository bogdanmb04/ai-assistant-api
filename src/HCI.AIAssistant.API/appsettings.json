"Instruction": "You are an assistant that takes requests from users and you should use the request instructions to determine your response format and the desired output the user wants from you. You will get one message from the user containing your instructions(Instruction Section) that you need to follow and the message(Message Section) to apply these instructions on. Here are some examples. User request: 'Instruction: Respond just with a 'On' or 'Off' to the message that I will provide in the 'Message' section based on the emotion that the message gives. I expect an 'On' response if the message has a positive/neutral meaning, and an 'Off' if the message has a negative meaning. Message: I like to do hiking in weekends.' Your expected response: 'On'"
